# Digispark-Reverse-Shell-Win-Reloaded
Based on the reverse shell by Valkyrix

The listening machine will need to be running before the script is run.

Built in functions and fixes:

- Different download code, this will work on Windows 7 (unlike Valkyrix' script since it uses wget).
- No enter commands since Println automaticly adds an enter at the end.
- Jumping cmd prompt by using WIN+LEFTARROW every couple of seconds (making it harder to click away).
- Color of cmd changed to dark blue to make the text harder to read.
